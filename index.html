        Liveable Neighbourhoods Explained
      </h2>
      <p class="ln-explained-text">
        What are Liveable Neighbourhoods? Essentially they are neighbourhoods
        where streets are for locals not through-traffic. Neighbourhoods with
        good air quality, safe walking and cycling routes, safe spaces for
        children to play, and improved public realm with more greenery and more
        outdoor seating.

          <a
            href="https://www.livingstreets.org.uk/media/3843/lcc021-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-intro-v8.pdf"

          >
          (also known as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, Access Only Neighbourhoods
          or Mini-Hollands) as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Low traffic neighbourhoods are groups of residential streets, bordered
          by main or 'distributor’ roads (the places where buses, lorries,
          non-local traffic should be), where 'through' motor vehicle traffic is
          discouraged or removed. There’s lots of ways you can make a low
          traffic neighbourhood, but the main principle is that every resident
          can drive onto their street, get deliveries etc., but it’s harder or
          impossible to drive straight through from one main road to the next.
          <b
            >With through traffic gone, the streets in a low traffic
            neighbourhood see dramatic reductions in motor traffic levels and
            often speeds too</b
          >.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Essentially Liveable Neighbourhoods are about removing rat-runs and
          ensuring the only cars using residential streets are to access the
          residential area itself, with through traffic instead using more
          appropriate perimeter routes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">How do Liveable Neighbourhoods work?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Liveable Neighbourhoods involve using 'connectors' that allow
          pedestrians and cyclists to pass through but not motor traffic. These
          connectors are placed at strategic locations around the neighbourhood
          and can be made using bollards or planters.
        </p>
        <p>
          These connectors prevent neighbourhoods being used as rat runs for
          non-local through traffic, while retaining full access for local
          residents and visitors. The connectors are located so that no
          attractive through routes remain across the neighbourhood, to ensure
          that traffic isn't just shifted to other residential streets.

          A number of London Boroughs have introduced Liveable Neighbourhoods,
          which provide a useful evidence base for their impacts. A

            href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/26/mini-holland-schemes-have-proved-their-worth-in-outer-london-boroughs"
            >Westminster University study</a
          >
          on the impacts of Liveable Neighbourhoods which have been introduced
          in London identified that:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          After one year, people living in parts of such boroughs were, on
          average, walking and cycling for 41 minutes a week more than those
          living in comparable areas.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          These Liveable Neighbourhood schemes have also been attributed with an

            >increase in life expectancy</a
          >
          of between seven to nine months for local residents due to a
          combination of increased activity and improved air quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Liveable Neighbourhoods don’t just encourage walking and
          cycling and improve air quality. They can change the entire nature of
          residential areas including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Children being able to play in the streets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Local businesses able to provide more outdoor seating.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tree planting and landscaping to make streets greener.
          </li>
          <li>
            Public realm improvements to make an area more visually attractive.
          </li>
          <li>

          Liveable Neighbourhoods have been implemented successfully in the UK,
          most notably in the London Borough of Waltham Forest with the schemes
          widely hailed as a huge success, and proving popular despite some
          initial opposition. A

          for the West of England has already identified St Werburgh’s and
          Southville as two areas of Bristol where Liveable Neighbourhoods could
          be implemented and Councillors Kye Dudd and Nicola Beech have both
          toured Liveable Neighbourhood schemes in Waltham Forest. So it’s very
          likely that they will come to some areas of Bristol in the future.

        When might we see Liveable Neighbourhoods in Bristol?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The LCWIP covers the period 2020-2036 so that equates to two Liveable
          Neighbourhoods over the next 15 years...
        </p>
        <p>
          Liveable Neighbourhoods can be cheap to implement compared to other
          transport schemes, as often a trial can be conducted with as little as
          a number of strategically placed bollards, planters or outdoor
          seating. So is the current level of ambition really good enough? Why
          should we wait decades for cleaner air and safer streets when it’s
          possible now?
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">
        What other areas of Bristol might see one?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Every neighbourhood in Bristol deserves clean air and safe streets so
          Liveable Neighbourhoods should be implemented across the whole of the
          city, not just in the two locations already identified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liveable Neighbourhoods can initially be trialled for 12-18 months
          before they are made permanent if they are popular. This way local
          residents and businesses are in control of the process and if the
          scheme is unpopular then it can be altered or removed entirely.

          local people in their local area. So use the tool above to find a

          local Councillors that the time for change has come! If you’re unsure
