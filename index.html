          Liveable Neighbourhoods Explained
        </h2>
        <div class="bodytext">
          <p>
            Liveable Neighbourhoods are residential neighbourhoods with traffic
            filters inside them to stop cars, vans and lorries using the streets
            as rat-runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liveable Neighbourhoods are a huge boon to local businesses. High
            streets in these areas become attractive destinations where people
            want to spend their time again and again, and so footfall and trade
            increase.
          </p>

          For too long streets have been treated simply as corridors that
          facilitate the movement of traffic. But they are so much more than
          that. Our streets also serve an important ‘place’ function where we
          meet and socialise, where our children play, where our local
          businesses are, where we walk and cycle, and where the public life of
          our neighbourhoods plays out. There are ways we can improve the place
          function of our streets and make them friendly for people and not just
          cars, while simultaneously improving our air quality and improving our
          health. However this doesn’t need to be to the detriment of car
          drivers so it really can be a win-win for all parties.

            (also known as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, Access Only
            Neighbourhoods or Mini-Hollands) as follows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Low traffic neighbourhoods are groups of residential streets,
            bordered by main or 'distributor’ roads (the places where buses,
            lorries, non-local traffic should be), where 'through' motor vehicle
            traffic is discouraged or removed. There’s lots of ways you can make
            a low traffic neighbourhood, but the main principle is that every
            resident can drive onto their street, get deliveries etc., but it’s
            harder or impossible to drive straight through from one main road to
            the next.
            <b
              >With through traffic gone, the streets in a low traffic
              neighbourhood see dramatic reductions in motor traffic levels and
              often speeds too</b
            >.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            One major aspect of Liveable Neighbourhoods is the removal of
            rat-runs to ensure that the only cars using residential streets are
            to access the residential area itself, with through traffic instead
            using more appropriate perimeter routes.

        <section class="faq__panel">
          <p>
            Liveable Neighbourhoods involve using &#39;connectors&#39; or ‘modal
            filters’ that allow pedestrians and cyclists to pass through but not
            motor traffic. These connectors are placed at strategic locations
            around the neighbourhood and can be made using bollards or planters.
          </p>
          <p>
            These connectors prevent neighbourhoods being used as rat runs for
            non-local through traffic, while retaining full access for local
            residents and visitors. The connectors are located so that no
            attractive through routes remain across the neighbourhood, to ensure
            that traffic isn't just shifted to other residential streets.

            We all know that the high street is struggling. Understandably
            business owners will be concerned about how any changes might affect
            their business and their livelihood. Local residents want to see
            thriving high streets and no vacant units. Fortunately, far from
            representing a threat to local businesses, Liveable Neighbourhoods
            are a great opportunity to increase footfall and increase trade.
            There is now a wealth of evidence which shows that pedestrian and
            cycle friendly schemes are a boon to high streets and are credited
            with average

          <p>
            This is intuitive. With the rise of internet shopping high streets
            need to serve more than just a basic retail function and become
            destinations where people enjoy spending their time. If public
            spaces are inviting then people will return time after time and in
            doing so will support their local businesses, creating vibrant and
            thriving high streets.

            Liveable Neighbourhoods can be cheap to implement compared to other
            transport schemes, as often a trial can be conducted with as little
            as a number of strategically placed bollards, planters or outdoor
            seating. So is the current level of ambition really good enough?
            Should we really have to wait decades for cleaner air and safer
            streets when it’s possible now?
          </p>

            The Liveable Neighbourhoods for Bristol Campaign is about
            accelerating the Liveable Neighbourhoods programme and getting
            Liveable Neighbourhoods implemented in all areas of the city in the
            shortest possible time.

            What other areas of Bristol might see Liveable Neighbourhoods?

          <p>
            Every neighbourhood in Bristol deserves clean air and safe streets
            so Liveable Neighbourhoods should be implemented across the whole of
            the city, not just in the two locations already identified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liveable Neighbourhoods can initially be trialled for 12-18 months
            before they are made permanent if they are popular. This way local
            residents and businesses are in control of the process and if the
            scheme is unpopular then it can be altered or removed entirely.
