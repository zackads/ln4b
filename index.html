          <p>
            Liveable Neighbourhoods are residential neighbourhoods with traffic
            filters inside them to stop cars, vans and lorries using the streets
            as rat-runs.

            Residents can still drive to their homes, residents and businesses
            can still get deliveries, and pedestrians and bikes can get through
            freely.

          <p>
            Liveable Neighbourhoods offer huge benefits for elderly and disabled
            people (and children) as reduced car traffic allows them to move
            around their neighbourhood safely.

            High streets in these areas become attractive destinations where
            people want to spend their time again and again, and so footfall and
            trade increase.

            What defines a Liveable Neighbourhood?
          </h3>
        </button>
        <section class="faq__panel">
          <p>
            A Liveable Neighbourhood is a group of residential streets that are
            bounded by the kind of main roads that buses, lorries, and non-local
            traffic should really be on, and discourages or prevents
            through-traffic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Residents and local businesses still have full access and can get
            deliveries, but the only way to pass from one main road to another
            is on foot or by bike.
          </p>
          <p>
            The schemes rely on traffic filters, which can be bollards or
            planters, for example. The filters are placed at strategic locations
            inside the neighbourhood so that no useful through-routes remain and
            rat-run traffic isn’t displaced onto other streets within the
            neighbourhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Liveable Neighbourhoods, the streets are for locals, not
            through-traffic.

        </button>
        <section class="faq__panel">
          <p>
            With through-traffic gone, the streets in Liveable Neighbourhoods
            see dramatic reductions in motor traffic, and often in traffic
            speeds too.

            Doesn’t the traffic cause congestion outside the Liveable
            Neighbourhoods?

        </button>
        <section class="faq__panel">
          <p>
            Not really. Just as new roads lead to an increase in traffic, taking
            some roads away for through-traffic leads to a decrease. Research
            shows that around 15% of displaced traffic can disappear from the
            area entirely as drivers avoid the area, change to a different form
            of transport, or even cancel their journeys. (More detail about this
            ‘traffic evaporation’
            <a
              href="https://bristolcycling.org.uk/induced-traffic-and-traffic-evaporation/"
              >here</a
            >.)
          </p>
          <p>
            A Westminster University study found no evidence that time spent in
            cars was increasing, which would be expected if congestion
            increased.

            By stopping rat-runs through neighbourhoods, do you displace traffic to main roads and make the environment worse for residents living on those roads?
          </h3>
        </button>
        <section class="faq__panel">
          <p>As you might expect, there isn’t a simple answer to this!</p>
          <p>1) The impact of displaced traffic to main roads is likely to be less than the impact of removing through-traffic on residential roads. That’s because the rat-running traffic may not be a huge volume. Enough to spoil residential streets, but maybe imperceptible when added to main roads, which are designed to carry high volumes efficiently.</p>
          <p>2) Any displacement to main roads may not be adding new traffic to roads that never used main roads before, but rather taking away the increase in rat-running traffic that has come about over the last decade or so from use of satnavs.  Studies have shown that traffic on residential streets has increased massively over the last few years with the advent of sat navs. If you told people on residential streets several years ago that this was planned there would have been uproar, yet somehow this situation has embedded itself as the status quo.</p>
          <p>3) The impact on traffic varies between schemes.  Whilst small-scale road closures lead to traffic displacement, this may cause minimal disruption on the nearby main roads, as discussed above.  Larger-scale or strategic closures may cause more disruption initially, but It can take months for traffic patterns to settle.  Studies have shown that over time traffic levels reduce.  Around 15% of displaced traffic may disappear from the area entirely as drivers adjust routes and behaviour – avoiding the area, changing modes or even cancelling journeys. The result is a couple of minutes’ extra on some resident journeys as they have to drive further round the edge of the cell before entering, but little substantive change to main road congestion.</p>
          <p>4) It is important to look at the wider picture. Liveable Neighbourhoods are just one element of transport policy. Other elements of transport policy include reallocating space on main roads to free up buses and make walking and cycling safer, and that will reduce the number of motor vehicles on main roads, improving the environment for those who live on main roads.</p>
          <p>5) There may be some increase in traffic on main roads in the short-term, but does that mean that Liveable Neighbourhoods are the wrong thing to do ?  Is that a reason not to bring the benefits of healthy streets to everyone who does not live on a main road, for instance to make roads safer for children?</p>
          <p>To summarise, displacement of traffic is a genuine concern – but the impact on main roads may be less than you would expect, and may just be a return to how things were a decade ago.</p>

            Do Liveable Neighbourhoods affect residents’ activity levels and

        <section class="faq__panel">
          <p>
            In London, several boroughs have introduced Liveable Neighbourhoods.
            Westminster University studied them after the changes had been in
            place for one year. The research compared people living in the parts
            of these boroughs that had been changed the most to favour active
            travel with those living in similar but unchanged areas. In the
            changed areas, people were, on average, walking and cycling for 41
            minutes a week more than the other areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers calculate that in Liveable Neighbourhoods, life
            expectancy increases by 7–9 months, due to improved air quality and
            residents’ increased activity.

          <p>
            Liveable Neighbourhoods are a great opportunity for businesses to
            get higher footfall and increase trade.
          </p>

            shows that schemes friendly to pedestrians and people on bikes are a
            real gift to high streets. Improvements to the pedestrian
            environment have led to average increases in footfall of 32% and
            retail turnover by 17%.
          </p>

          <p>
            This makes sense. The rise of internet shopping means that high
            streets need to do more than just sell things. They need to become
            destinations where people enjoy spending their time and will keep
            returning.

            Liveable Neighbourhoods have been implemented successfully in the
            UK. Despite some initial opposition, they have proved popular with
            residents and been widely hailed as a huge success.

            The Draft Local Walking and Cycling Infrastructure Plan for the West
            of England identifies St Werburgh’s and Southville as two areas of
            Bristol where Liveable Neighbourhoods could be implemented. But the
            plan covers the period 2020-2036 so that means only two Liveable
            Neighbourhoods over the next 15 years.

            Councillor Kye Dudd, Cabinet Member for Transport, and Councillor

            But any new scheme affecting traffic is often controversial, and it
            will be important for us local people to show our support for
            Liveable Neighbourhoods for the council to take the political risk
            of implementing the schemes.

            Liveable Neighbourhoods can initially be trialled for 12–18 months
            before they are made permanent if they are popular (and they almost
            always are). This way, local residents and businesses are in control
            of the process and if the scheme is unpopular then it can be altered
            or removed entirely.

            This all sounds great. Are you asking the council to help us get

            Our open letter to the mayor and each councillor – also for the
            attention of all Bristol candidates in the upcoming 2021 local
            elections – is below, and has been co-signed by organisations that
            support the request.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘We are writing as a network of Bristol organisations to ask you to
            work with local people to create Liveable Neighbourhoods across the
            city, starting now and completing by the end of the next mayoral and
            council term in May 2024.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘As you will know, Liveable Neighbourhoods are residential areas
            that contain traffic filters to stop cars, vans and lorries using
            the streets as rat-runs. Residents can still drive to their homes,
            residents and businesses can still get deliveries, and pedestrians
            and bikes can get through freely.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘In Liveable Neighbourhoods, the resulting reduced traffic has many
            benefits. Air quality improves. So does road safety. Social
            distancing is easier. There is safe space for play areas for
            children, and room for outdoor seating for businesses. Tree-planting
            and landscaping can be done, making the streets greener and more
            pleasant.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Residents’ life expectancy improves because the air is cleaner and
            they walk and cycle more. High streets in Liveable Neighbourhoods
            become attractive destinations where people want to spend their time
            again and again, and so footfall and trade increase.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘As well as these benefits for citizens, Liveable Neighbourhoods
            would help the council meet its One City plans for a healthy and
            sustainable city, including its goal for a carbon-neutral Bristol by
            2030.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘We are encouraged by the
            <a

            by Councillor Kye Dudd, Cabinet Member for Transport, that the
            council will be bringing forward initial proposals for liveable
            streets with less traffic on local roads as soon as possible, and
            that it will be be keen to engage with communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘To this end, Liveable Neighbourhood Facebook groups have been set
            up in each local area in Bristol, and we invite you – the mayor and
            current councillors – as well as prospective councillors, to join
            the discussion in your local groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘We have also started a petition that people in Bristol can sign to
            ask for Liveable Neighbourhoods to show their support for this
            policy. More information, and signposting to local Liveable
            Neighbourhood Facebook groups, can be found on our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘The extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic present
            a perhaps once-in-a-generation opportunity to build back better. We
            hope that we can help each other to do this.
          </p>

            this form submission.
